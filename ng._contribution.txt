Part of contribution: Navigation Functionality

I have contributed to the Navigation Functionality section of the user manual, covering slides 6 to 12 in Canva.

The following elements, along with short explanations, are presented in the Navigation section:
1. Create A New Account (Sign Up & Sign In)
2. Home Page
3. Searching a Product
4. About Us
5. Contact Us (Customer Support)

Each element includes screenshots designed in Figma to illustrate the key features respectively.
