Part of contribution: Functionality Guide

I completed the Functionality Guide section of the user manual, covering slides 13 +to 16 in Canva.

This section outlines the following features available on the website:
1. Product Categories
2. Wishlist
3. Checkout & Payment
4. My Orders

I provided step-by-step instructions on how to use each feature effectively, encouraging users to explore and fully utilize the website's capabilities.
